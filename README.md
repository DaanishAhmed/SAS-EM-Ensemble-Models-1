Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests on Vehicle Purchase Data
----------------

This project involves using SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze a dataset containing vehicle purchase information.  My goal is to use ensemble models, which combine distinct models and average their outputs.  I will create bagging, boosting, gradient boosting, and random forest models--all of which are ensemble variants of the decision tree.  My goal is to determine which of these methods is the most accurate, and which is most effective at classifying bad vehicle purchases.

The full report can be found in the file "Ensemble Models 1.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data sampling, ensemble model development, model results, model comparison, and proposed solutions.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The dataset "car lemon data set.csv" was provided by my course instructor at the University of Maryland University College.  The variable descriptions are included in the file "car lemon data set description.docx".  To use the dataset, it must be converted to a .sas7bdat file, which can be done using SAS Enterprise Miner.  Next, the data source must be imported into your SAS EM project.

The process flow diagrams I created for this project (seen in Figures 1-3 of my report's appendix) are included in the .xml files titled "ensemble diagram" 1, 2, and 3.  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  To use these diagrams, you need to import the .xml diagrams into your SAS EM project.
